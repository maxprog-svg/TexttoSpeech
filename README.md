Text-to-Speech (TTS) Program in Python

This Python program uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert text in English, Spanish, and Russian into spoken words. The program allows users to input text in any of these languages and outputs an audio file that can be played back.

To run the program, you'll need to install the gTTS library. You can do this using pip:

pip install gTTS

Usage:
  
    Enter the text you want to convert.
    Specify the language code ('en' for English, 'es' for Spanish, 'ru' for Russian).
    The audio file will be generated and played automatically.

This program is a simple yet effective way to turn text into speech, useful for language learning, accessibility, and entertainment purposes.
